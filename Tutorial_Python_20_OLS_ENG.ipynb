    "\n",
    "Simply put, econometrics involves using statistical models to analyse economic data and draw conclusions. It doesn't matter if you're new to econometrics. We'll start with the basics, focusing on the tools and ideas you'll need to use Python for analysis. If you have some experience of econometrics, you will find that Python makes the application of these concepts easier and more interactive.\n",

    "In this course, we use statistical models to explain and predict relationships in data. We'll learn how to use statsmodels, a Python package specifically designed to build and estimate statistical models. You can explore its documentation here for reference: [docs](https://devdocs.io/statsmodels/).\n",

    "\n",
    "To begin understanding econometrics, let’s frame a typical problem that economists encounter: identifying relationships between variables based on data from $ N $ observations. Suppose we are interested in a particular outcome or *explained variable*, which we’ll call $ y $. We also have data on several other factors, called *explanatory variables*, which we think may help to explain $ y $. Let’s denote these explanatory variables as $ x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_p $.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose an economist wants to predict future movements in a stock market index, like the S&P 500. They might use variables like interest rates, inflation, or other economic indicators as part of $ X $ to explain $ y $, the index level. Here, the *prediction* is based on an econometric model that estimates the relationship between $ y $ and $ X $. This approach not only enables forecasts of $ y $ but also allows for interpretation, giving insights into *how* and *why* changes in economic factors influence the S&P 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "In econometrics, we assume that $ y $ is related to the $ x $ variables through a model we write as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = f(X) + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ y $ is the dependent variable, \n",
    "- $ X $ is the matrix of the explanatory variables,\n",
    "- $ f(.) $ is the function that represents the *systematic* or *structural* relationship between $ X $ and $ y$,\n",
    "- and $ \\epsilon $ is the *noise* or *error term* which accounts for the variation in $ y $ that isn’t explained by $ X $ alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal in econometrics is to estimate $ f(.) $ which allows us to understand the relationship between $ y $ and $ X $. Estimating this relationship provides valuable insights into how changes in the explanatory variables impact the outcome. By analyzing this relationship, economists can also make predictions for $ y $ based on new values of $ X $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's clarify right now how we link each observation - our dataset - with this equation. Our goal here is to find an equation $ y = f(X) + \\epsilon$ that is designed to hold for each observation in our dataset. In other words, it means that this relationship holds for every individual observation $ i $, with $ i = 1, 2, \\dots, N $:\n",
    "\n",

    "- and $ \\epsilon_i $ is the error term for that  $ i $-th observation.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 2. Specifying the model\n",

    "For example, suppose we want to study the effect of online advertising spending on e-commerce sales. The dependent variable $y$ could represent monthly sales, while the explanatory variables $X$ might include advertising expenditures, website traffic, and customer demographics. If our goal is to estimate the causal effect of advertising, we need to ensure that advertising expenditures are appropriately included as part of $X$. Moreover, our model should allow us to interpret results meaningfully, such as estimating the advertising elasticity of demand. Understanding this relationship helps in decision-making, like optimizing digital marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assume that the relationship between $y$ and $X$ is linear. Linear regression is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, and because many complex relationships can be approximated or broken down into linear components, making it a multi-faceted starting point for modelling.

    "1. **How does $\\beta$ affect the slope?**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta$ is the slope of the deterministic part of the Data-Generating Process (DGP). If we change $\\beta$, we scale the systematic relationship between $X$ and $Y$. A larger $\\beta$ means a steeper slope, while a smaller $\\beta$ means a flatter slope. Graphically, the regression line $Y = \\beta X$ rotates around the origin (in our simple model with no intercept).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Does increasing $\\beta$ make observations more spread out or closer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of $Y$ is (assuming $X$ and $\\varepsilon$ are independent):\n",

    "Var(Y)=Var(\\beta X + \\epsilon)= \\beta^2 Var(X)+Var(\\epsilon)\n",
    "$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $|\\beta|$ increases, the term $\\beta^2 Var (X)$ grows, so the total variance of $Y$ increases — the observations become more spread out vertically. Intuitively, scaling the systematic part $\\beta X$ stretches the cloud of points along the $Y$-axis. The noise term $\\varepsilon$ remains the same but its relative importance diminishes when $\\beta$ is large.\n",

    "Since we assume that the relationship between $Y$ and $X$ is linear through $f$, this means that we want to draw a line that passes through the data points starting from the origin. We want this line to pass through as many data points as possible. Intuitively, you can think of placing a ruler at the point $(0,0)$ and rotating it until the line seems to capture the overall trend of the data — we will now formalize this idea mathematically.\n",

Given that $ E(\\epsilon_j) = 0 $, we have $ E\\left(\\sum_j X_j \\epsilon_j\\right) = \\sum_j 0 = 0 $.

    "\n",
    "We propose here to connect the Python code to the matrix notation by explaining the key calculations in the mathematical framework of linear regression. The relationship between the dependent variable \\( Y \\) and the independent variable \\( X \\) in matrix form is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = X \\beta + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ Y $ is the $ N \\times 1 $ vector of observed dependent variables.\n",
    "- $ X $ is the $ N \\times p $ matrix of independent variables (in your example, \\( X \\) is a column vector since there is one independent variable).\n",
    "- $ \\beta $ is the $ p \\times 1 $ vector of coefficients to be estimated.\n",
    "- $ \\epsilon $ is the $ N \\times 1 $ vector of residuals (errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate for $ \\beta $ is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{X^\\top Y}{X^\\top X}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This formula minimizes the sum of squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping to the Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate $\\hat{\\beta}$:**\n",
    "   - The numerator in the code, `np.sum(Y * X)`, corresponds to $ X^\\top Y $, the inner product of $ X $ and $ Y $.\n",
    "   - The denominator, `np.sum(X * X)`, corresponds to $ X^\\top X $, the inner product of $ X $ with itself.\n",
    "   - The division `numerator / denominator` gives $ \\hat{\\beta} $, the estimated coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predict $ Y $:**\n",
    "   - `Yhat = X * bhat` calculates the predicted values, corresponding to $ \\hat{Y} = X \\hat{\\beta} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plot the Data and Model:**\n",
    "   - The scatter plot visualizes the data points ($ Y $ vs. $ X $).\n",
    "   - The line plot shows the fitted regression line ($ \\hat{Y} $ vs. $ X $).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Annotation:**\n",
    "   - The annotation in the plot highlights the estimated $ \\hat{\\beta} $ value, providing a numerical summary of the slope of the regression line.\n",

    "- Detect outliers or errors: Extreme values or inconsistencies can distort our analysis, so identifying them early is crucial.\n",
    "- View variability: The spread of variables via standard deviation helps us interpret regression results later. For example, if `sleep` has very little variation, it can be harder to explain differences using predictors.\n",

    "In econometrics, a clear and efficient model is crucial, especially when dealing with multiple variables, transformations, or categorical data. The `patsy` package in Python is designed to simplify this process by providing a formal syntax for defining econometric models, very similar to the syntax used in R. Using `patsy`, we can describe models using strings. The basic syntax is:\n",

    "One of the key advantages of `patsy` is that it automatically includes the constant term unless specified otherwise and supports more complex specifications like interactions, polynomial terms, and encoding categorical variables. It allows for a structured and concise definition of econometric models, enabling us to focus on data and results rather than on manual model setup.\n",

Let’s break it down step by step in a way that assumes no prior econometric knowledge but some familiarity with economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of the table**\n",
    "- Dependent variable: The regression aims to predict `sleep` based on `totwrk`, `educ` and `age`\n",
    "- R-squared (0.113): About 11.3% of the variation in `sleep` can be explained by the variables `totwrk`, `educ` and `age`. This number shows how well the model fits the data. A higher value means better explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coefficients: Each coefficient tells us the estimated impact of the variable on sleep\n",
    "- Intercept ($3638.2453$): Predicted amount of sleep (in min.) when all explanatory variables (totwrk,educ,age) are zero. Since it's rare for someone to have zero work hours, education, or age, this value is less interpretable directly but anchors the regression line.\n",
    "- `totwrk` ($-0.1484$): For an additional hour worked, sleep decreases by approximately $0.148 \\times 60 \\sim 8.9$ min., assuming other variables remain constant.\n",
    "    - Significance: The p-value (<0.001) indicates this relationship is highly statistically significant, meaning there’s strong evidence that more work is associated with less sleep.\n",
    "- `educ` ($-11.1338$): An additional year of education decreases sleep by about $11$ min., holding other variables constant.\n",
    "     - Significance: With a p-value of $0.059$, this is marginally significant, suggesting a weak or uncertain effect.\n",
    "- `age` ($2.1999$): An additional year of age is associated with an increase in sleep by about $2.2$ min.\n",
    "    - Significance: The p-value ($0.129$) suggests this relationship isn’t statistically significant, meaning we can’t confidently conclude that age affects sleep in this sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Statistical indicators\n",
    "- F-statistic ($29.92$) and Prob (F-statistic): These test whether all the explanatory variables collectively have an effect on sleep. The very small p-value ($3.28 \\times 10−18$) indicates that at least one variable significantly affects sleep.\n",
    "- Log-Likelihood ($-5263.1$), AIC ($1.053e+04$), BIC ($1.055e+04$): These are measures of model quality. Lower values generally indicate better fit but are harder to interpret intuitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Diagnostics\n",
    "- Omnibus ($68.731$) and Jarque-Bera ($185.551$): These test whether the model's residuals (errors) are normally distributed. The small p-values suggest deviations from normality.\n",
    "- Durbin-Watson ($1.943$): This tests for autocorrelation in the residuals. A value near $2$ suggests no strong autocorrelation, which is good.\n",
    "- Condition Number ($1.66e+04$): A high number indicates potential multicollinearity (when variables are highly correlated, making estimates unstable). This may warrant further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Time is limited: When people work more hours, they tend to sleep less. This aligns with economic reasoning about trade-offs in time allocation.\n",

    "- Age’s weak positive effect suggests older individuals might prioritize rest more, though this isn’t statistically strong here.\n",

    "This analysis provides a quantitative way to test the idea that work reduces sleep. The p-values indicate which effects we can be confident in (e.g., work hours) and which require caution (e.g., education, age), and low R2 suggests the model could be improved by adding other relevant factors, such as health, income, or lifestyle habits.\n",

    "#### Interacting variables\n",
    "To include interactions between two variables in a regression model, use the `*` operator in the formula. This operator not only creates the interaction term but also includes the main effects of the variables involved.\n",

    "For example, consider interacting education (`educ`) and age (`age`) in our regression model. The resulting equation is:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $age \\times educ$ is the interaction term, capturing how the effect of one variable changes depending on the level of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why study interaction?**\n",
    "Studying interaction terms allows us to uncover relationships in the data that would otherwise remain hidden in a standard linear model. Interaction terms help us understand how the effect of one variable depends on the level of another, making it possible to explore conditional effects. For instance, the relationship between education and sleep might vary across different age groups, revealing patterns that a simpler model might overlook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including interaction terms also enables us to capture synergies or trade-offs between variables. In some cases, two variables may work together in a complementary or conflicting manner, and modeling these dynamics provides a more accurate representation of the underlying relationships. This leads to richer insights by highlighting nuances in the data. For example, while education alone might not have a strong effect on sleep, its interaction with age could uncover meaningful variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, interaction terms improve the overall fit of a regression model by accounting for variability that is missed when only main effects are considered. By incorporating these terms, we go beyond simple linear relationships and achieve a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the data."
